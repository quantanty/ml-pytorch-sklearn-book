Through this chapter, I have gained a comprehensive understanding of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). I have learned how to utilize Python to implement CNNs for image classification tasks. Compared to neural networks consisting solely of fully connected layers, CNNs demonstrated significantly improved performance.

\subsection{Future Work}
In subsequent chapters, I aim to delve into more advanced models, such as recurrent neural networks and transformers.
