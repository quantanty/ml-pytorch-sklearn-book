\subsection{Key Takeaways}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Properties of sequences that make them different from other types of data such as structured data or images.
    \item Foundations of RNNs for sequence modeling: how a basic RNN model works and its limitations with regard to capturing long-term dependencies in sequence data.
    \item LSTM cells consist of a gating mechanism to reduce the effect of exploding and vanishing gradient problems, which are common in basic RNN models.
    \item implemnt RNNs with Pytorch.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Challenges Encountered}
\begin{itemize}
    \item It's difficult to find a unified definition for each concept.
    \item I fell into the perfectionism trap.
    \item Writing report is an open-ended task.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Opening Questions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item embedding in character level models?
    \item what after RNNs?
\end{itemize}
